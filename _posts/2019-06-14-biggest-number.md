I've got a new youtube video. It is my entry to the [Breakthrough Junior Challenge](http://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/), a competition where teenagers make a 3 minute video
about Math, Physics, or Life Sciences. My entry was titled "What Is The Biggest Number?" It's all about infinity and the different infinities.
You can check it out at the link below.
